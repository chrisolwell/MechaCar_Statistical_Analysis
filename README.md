## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
To determine the impact of various vehicle characteristics on its miles per gallon, we used a multiple linear regression model run through R Studio. We input data points for each vehicle's weight, length, ground clearnace, spoiler angle, mpg and whether it is all wheel drive or two wheel drive. Our null hypothesis is that these variables have no impact on a vehicle's mileage

Our linear regression shows extremely low p-values for vehicle length and ground clearance, and relatively greater values for spoiler angle and AWD. The writer finds these results counterintuitive, as he'd would've bet a week's wages that a vehicle's weight would have more impact on its mileage than it length would have, and that ground clearance would have a neglegable impact at most. 

<!-- (The writer briefly considered fashioning a multiple linear regression to determine the probability that he misunderstands the results, but he quickly dismissed the idea because even if he could program such a regression, he probably would misunderstand the results.) -->
