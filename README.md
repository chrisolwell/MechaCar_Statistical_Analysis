## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
To determine the impact of various vehicle characteristics on its miles per gallon, we used a multiple linear regression model run through R Studio. We input data points for each vehicle's weight, length, ground clearnace, spoiler angle, mpg and whether it is all wheel drive or two wheel drive. Our null hypothesis is that these variables have no impact on a vehicle's mileage

Our linear regression shows extremely low p-values for vehicle length and ground clearance, and relatively greater values for spoiler angle and AWD. The writer finds these results counterintuitive, as he'd would've expected  a vehicle's weight would have more impact on its mileage than its length, and that ground clearance would have a negligable impact at most.

Because the multiple regression has r-values near .70 and an extremely low p-value, we can conclude this combonation of variables has a significant impact on mileage. However, because the intercept is so significant, there are likely improvements we could make to improve the predictive value of the model.
